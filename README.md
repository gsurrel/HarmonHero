## Introduction

This plans to be an interactive HTML5 gamification for playing the harmonica: the notes are displayed and your performance is scored thanks to the use of the microphone. **You therefore need a physical harmonica!**

## Grand Master Plan

- [x] Have spectral analysis of the signal
- [ ] Detect notes
- [ ] Have an animated score
- [ ] Match the played notes with the score, taking into account a possible lag
- [ ] Have a basic game concept
- [ ] Let the user create his own scores by playing
